        # Two Types of Export and Import 

        -Default Export/Import
        export default jjjj

        export default Component;
        import Component from "path";


        -Named Export/Import

        export const Component;
        import {Component} from "path"



        #React Hooks
        (Normal JS utility Functions )
        -useState()- super powerful State Varables in React 
        -useEffect()


        when we were using the filter method without hook ,it was giving us the result in consolelog but was not updating the ui ,but if we use useStat and set method of it ,it updates the ui also,so this is due to state variable when we were using normal variable it was not updating 

        whenever state variable changes react will rerender my component
